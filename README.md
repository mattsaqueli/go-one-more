# Go One More

## Context:
Welcome to Go One More, the platform dedicated to supporting veterans in their transition from the military and addressing mental health challenges. We understand that transitioning to civilian life can be a daunting process, and we are here to provide a helping hand and a source of inspiration to improve your mental well-being on this transformative journey.

Go One More was created by a veteran who has personally experienced the unique struggles faced by those transitioning out of the military. We have designed our platform to specifically address the needs of veterans and provide them with the support they deserve. Our founder's firsthand experience allows us to offer valuable insights and a deep understanding of the challenges you may encounter during this phase of your life.

## Learning Goals:
- Strength skills with the technologies used
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Wins/Challenges:
Win: On this project I began to feel much more comfortable building an app within React using Router. My code is clean, easy to follow along, and readable.
Challenge: Im still working on my comfortability level within Cypress, although it has improved trendmendously, there are some things that I will spend more time on.

## Future Addition:
- Form input so users can add their own quotes.
